<h3>Six Marketing Focused Data Analytics Cases</h3>

<p>These are cases from a marketing class I took that covered basic experimentation concepts. The projects demonstrate practical application of various statistical and experimental design techniques in marketing contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Main Concepts Covered:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Potential Outcomes framework</li>
    <li>Experimentation design and implementation</li>
    <li>A/B Testing and A/B/n Testing methodologies</li>
    <li>Group Sequential Designs</li>
    <li>Propensity Score Matching and Weighting</li>
    <li>Uplift modeling with Causal Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Heterogeneous Treatment Effects analysis</li>
    <li>Fixed Effects modeling</li>
    <li>Difference-in-Differences approach</li>
    <li>Synthetic Control methods</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Skills Developed:</strong> Through these cases, I gained hands-on experience with advanced statistical techniques for causal inference, experimental design, and treatment effect estimation - all crucial skills for data-driven marketing decision making.</p>

<p><strong>Applications:</strong> These techniques are directly applicable to real-world marketing scenarios such as campaign effectiveness measurement, customer targeting optimization, and ROI analysis of marketing interventions.</p>
