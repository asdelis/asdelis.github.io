    <h3>TV Show Popularity Analysis</h3>

    <p>I conducted this project to identify which factors influenced TV show popularity in 2024. As someone outside the industry, I was curious about what types of television content resonate most with audiences, which could potentially help streaming services make better decisions about which shows to produce.</p>

    <p><strong>The project includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>An analysis document detailing my approach and findings</li>
        <li>Application of multiple statistical techniques to identify patterns in TV show popularity</li>
        <li>Clear recommendations based on the analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the analysis portion, I employed various techniques including penalized regression (both lasso and ridge), clustering methods (partition and hierarchical), and principal component analysis. The regression models were particularly valuable in identifying confounding variables and isolating the most influential factors affecting a show's popularity.</p>

    <p>The final results indicated that genre plays a crucial role in determining popularity, with soap operas from outside the US performing particularly well. Additionally, I found that family-friendly content tends to outperform adult-oriented shows. The clustering analysis revealed potential for even more refined segmentation, suggesting opportunities for further research.</p>

    <p>My recommendations to streaming services include being strategic about genre selection, considering international soap operas as potential acquisitions, and prioritizing content suitable for general audiences. I estimated that following these recommendations could significantly increase the popularity scores of new content releases.</p>
