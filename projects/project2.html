    <h3>Home Credit Kaggle Competition Project</h3>

    <p>Home Credit is a loan provider with a mission to "broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience." Understanding the real indicators for a prospective client's repayment ability is imperative to their financial and existential missions.</p>

    <p>The goal of this Kaggle competition is to create a model that will more accurately predict their customer's repayment abilities. In their own words, creating this model will "ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful."</p>

    <p>I worked in a group of four for this project. We first cleaned the data. Then each member of our group decided to each take a model and see how it performed. I personally used a decision tree. I also used PCA to see if that improved the decision treeâ€™s performance.</p>

    <p>The decision tree achieved 65% accuracy on its own but didn't beat the majority class (91%) probably due to some overfitting. PCA did not improve the model's performance - the dataset included many categorical variables, and one-hot-encoding these made PCA's dimensionality reduction much less effective.</p>

    <p>PCA did not improve the model's performance. The data set included many categorical variables, and one-hot-encoding these in order to do PCA made the dimensionality reduction capabilities of PCA much less potent.</p>

    <p>The model that performed best was an MLP model. Surprisingly, it performed roughly the same depending on whether the data was cleaned (71% accuracy) or not (69% accuracy). However, due to it being a black box model, identifying an actionable business plan based on the analysis (outside of just handing the model over to Home Credit) was very difficult to come up with.</p>

    <p>This was my first time working with a very large and imperfect data set. My big picture take-aways are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I understand the "most of my job is actually just cleaning the data" comments better now</li>
        <li>Model tuning can be the most time consuming part of a machine learning project</li>
        <li>Black box models are powerful, but aptly named</li>
    </ul>
