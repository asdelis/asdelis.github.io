<h3>Home Credit Kaggle Competition Project</h3>

<p>Home Credit is a loan provider with a mission to "broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience." Understanding the real indicators for a prospective client's repayment ability is imperative to their financial and existential missions.</p>

<p><strong>Project Goal:</strong> The goal of this Kaggle competition is to create a model that will more accurately predict their customer's repayment abilities. In their own words, creating this model will "ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful."</p>

<p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Worked in a group of four for this project</li>
    <li>First cleaned the data, then each member took a different model approach</li>
    <li>I personally used a decision tree and applied PCA to see if it improved performance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> The decision tree achieved 65% accuracy on its own but didn't beat the majority class (91%) probably due to some overfitting. PCA did not improve the model's performance - the dataset included many categorical variables, and one-hot-encoding these made PCA's dimensionality reduction much less effective.</p>

<p><strong>Best Model:</strong> An MLP model performed best, achieving 71% accuracy with cleaned data and 69% accuracy without cleaning. However, being a black box model made it difficult to identify actionable business insights.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Understanding why "most of my job is actually just cleaning the data"</li>
    <li>Model tuning can be the most time consuming part of a machine learning project</li>
    <li>Black box models are powerful, but aptly named</li>
</ul>
