## Projects

***SWIRE - COCA COLA Forecasting***

Swire Coca-Cola, USA, is responsible for producing, selling, and distributing Coca-Cola and various other beverages across 13 states in the American West. Swire Coca-Cola has encountered significant production and inventory management challenges with its new innovative products, Starlight and Dreamworld, exhibiting distinct sales patterns. Swire plans to release seven new innovative products. The main aim is to enhance its production planning and management specifically for these innovative products, thereby maximizing profits.

Exploratory Data Analysis thoroughly examined the product's sales data, identifying key insights such as peak sales periods and notable seasonal trends, and analyzed the demographic dataset. Products that closely matched the innovative items were selected, ensuring they aligned closely with the specifications of the new products. Used time series forecasting models to predict future sales. I also utilized non-Swire competitive data to compare sales to identify patterns and public sentiments.

***Home Default Risk***

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. To ensure this underserved population has a favorable loan experience, Home Credit uses various alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

These notebooks examine the Home Credit default risk Exploration Data Analysis with data cleaning, explorations, hypothesis questions, and visualizations. Subsequently, we developed predictive models using the cleaned data to assess credit default risk. We focused on the target variable and employed different machine learning models, calculating relevant metrics like accuracy and ROC values, and achieved 0.73 accuracy.

***Iowa Home Price Prediction***

Every home buyer needs to buy their dream house, but estimating the cost of the house is difficult. So, building the statistical machine learning model will estimate the price of the house using the variables (predictors) from the house.

This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a model that estimates house prices in Ames, Iowa, using readily available information about the prices of houses themselves. The main aim of this project is to predict the house prices in Ames, Iowa, with the given variables (predictors) and predict the SalePrice (Target Variable). We start with the data collection from the Kaggle and clean and Explore the data as part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Later, we defined the statistical machine-learning model linear regression to predict the prices of houses in Ames, Iowa, which resulted in 0.9 accuracy.
